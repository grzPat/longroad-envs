# longroad-envs

Scalable Multi Agent Environment abstractly based on traffic control. This environment is simple but good for debugging large scale multi-agent reinforcement algorithms. The current state is mostly for review only as used in my thesis. A more productive version of this environment will be released soon.

## TODOS:
1. Add extensively comments
2. Add exentsively tests
3. Add rendering functionality
4. Add basic learning scripts
5. Add complete building process plus wheel/pypi
6. Refactor Code
7. Add continous control version.
